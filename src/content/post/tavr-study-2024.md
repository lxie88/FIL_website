We are pleased to announce the publication of our latest research paper titled "Effects of Implantation Height on the Performance of a Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using a Balloon-Expandable Valve" in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (JTCVS) Open.

## Research Highlights

Our study investigated:
- Impact of valve-in-valve implantation height on hemodynamics
- Flow characteristics in different TAVR configurations
- Optimization strategies for redo procedures
- Computational fluid dynamics analysis of various deployment scenarios

This research provides valuable insights for clinicians performing redo TAVR procedures and contributes to improving patient outcomes in cardiovascular interventions.
